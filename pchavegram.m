% This function computes the multi-taper spectrogram of a given signal.
% IN:
% y: signal
% nw: time-halfbandwidth product
% window: size of window in samples for sliding window
% noverlap: size of overlap in samples
% f: frequencies
% fs: smapling frequency
% ax: handle to axis in which to plot
% 
% TO DO:
% - unfinished totally, just a copy of mtgram right now
