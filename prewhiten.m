% This function prewhitens a time series by fitting autoregressive
% coefficients describing an AR(p) process such that the process has a
% spectrum that closely matches the spectrum of the time series. As
% described in Percival and Walden (Ch 11), these coefficients are then
% used to compute a whitened time series: 
% X(t) = X(t-1)*a(1) + ... + X(t-p)*a(p) + W(t), t = 1...n 
% where X(t) is the time series we observe and W(t) is the whitenened time 
% series we can recover by applying the coefficients "in reverse", allowing
% us to recover n-p samples of W(t).
% The current implementation uses ARfit() to estimate the lag coefficients
% of the given process from the frequency domain.
% 
% IN:
% ts: input time series. must be a vector in the current implementation
% 'process': (default 'ar') 'ar' or 'pink'; type of spectrum to fit to
%   background spectrum of time series
% 'ncoeff': (default 4) number of coefficients to fit either to
%   AR(p) process or to pink noise process
% 'nw': (default 2) time half bandwidth product for computing spectrum from
%   which the lag coefficients are estimated
%
% OUT:
% ws: whitened time series
% a: lag coefficients used for prewhitening
%
% TO DO:
% - could be generalized to prewhitening by any sort of autoregressive
%   process; i.e. we could force prewhitening by a pink noise process.
%   Might consider making particular functions or need to think of a
%   general way to implement prewhitening by restricting the set of
%   coefficients a(1)...a(p)
